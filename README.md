# Macaroons for Scala

This library implements [Macaroons: Cookies with Contextual Caveats for Decentralized Authorization in the Cloud](https://research.google/pubs/pub41892/), which are [inexplicably underused](https://latacora.micro.blog/a-childs-garden/), for [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

It uses the [libmacaroons binary format](https://github.com/rescrv/libmacaroons/blob/master/doc/format.txt) with HMAC-SHA256 for authenticating macaroons, SHA256 for binding them, and XChaCha20-Poly1305 for encrypting verification keys.

> **Note**: Not ready for production use yet.

## Getting started

### Adding `scala-macaroons` as a dependency

Add to `build.sbt`:

```scala
dependsOn(
  ProjectRef(
    uri("git://github.com/sander/scala-macaroons.git#main"),
    "core"))
```

### Baking macaroons

See [PhotoService](modules/core/src/test/scala/nl/sanderdijkhuis/macaroons/example/PhotoService.scala) for an example walkthrough.

## Maintenance
